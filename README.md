# AnalysisGUI
I created a Python GUI using PyQt5 and reportlab for easy data analysis that converts FLB data recorded by a rehabilitation robot, processes it, and calculates kinetic and kinematic parameters like stiffness and improvement of patients over time. This GUI generates a report for each test session and compares different test sessions result together.
